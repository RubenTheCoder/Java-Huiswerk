# Java Wars

<br>
<br>
<br>

### Episode 1
### The Java Menice

<br>

Turmoil has engulfed RubenTheCoder's GitHub repos. The hope of learning Java is in dispute.
Hoping to resolve the matter with a blockade of deadly frameworks, the greedy Maven Federation has stopped all shipping to the small repository of Java-Huiswerk.
While the congress of the Republic endlessly debates this alarming chain of events, the Supreme Chancellor has secretly dispatched StackOverflow, the guardian of knowledge in the world wide web, to settle the conflict....

### Syntax
- `==` does not work as `==`, you need `equals()`, but `>=` and `<=` do work!
- Its a whole mouthfull to type `public static void main(String[] args){}` when other languages just have `public function main(){}`
- Apparently a comment can break Java because you added '\u'. Example: `// Default folder is c:\users\default` -> `Invalid Unicode`
- The way you have to struggle with Scanners and NextIn to read user input, theres no way to describe to it
- `System.out.println("Welcome to the Students list");` could have been as short as `print()`

### Data types
- Strings are objects... WHY!?
- You have to import objects (HashMaps) in the most OOP language ever...
- Variables in switch statements leak, so you also need to use brackets to enclose thos
- Whatever this is:

- **RubenTheCoder:** `import java.util *;`
- **Visual Studio Code:** Do you hear that? [a rumbling is heard in the distance]
- **RubenTheCoder:** Yeah.
- **Visual Studio Code:** That is the sound of a thousand dependancies headed this way.
- **GitHub:** If and when they find your RAM, they will crush it, grind it into tiny pieces and blast it into oblivion!
- **RubenTheCoder:** Hmmm... yousa point is well seen. This way. Hurry!

### Folder structure
- Having a second folder for Java files adds a package line that you can't remove without breaking the code, so you need a Repo for every day of homework
- All hundreds of class files you have get squashed into one folder
