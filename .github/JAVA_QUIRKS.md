### Syntax
- `==` does not work as `==`, you need `equals()`, but `>=` and `<=` do work!
- Its a whole mouthfull to type `public static void main(String[] args){}` when other languages just have `public function main(){}`
- Apparently a comment can break Java because you added '\u'. Example: `// Default folder is c:\users\default` -> `Invalid Unicode`
- The way you have to struggle with Scanners and NextIn to read user input, theres no way to describe to it

### Data types
- Strings are objects... WHY!!!
- You have to import HashMaps (objects) in the most OOP language ever...

### Folder structure
- Having a second folder for Java files adds a package line that you can't remove without breaking the code, so you need a Repo for every day of homework
